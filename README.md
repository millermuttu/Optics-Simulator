# Welcome to the Optics simulator webapp.

- designing the spectrometer or buying an spectrometer is always a costly affair, after buying the components required to build a spectrometer and realizing that they are not suitable or fit for your requirement is waste of time and money. With this simulater you can go through the guided steps to arrive at your required specification for the design you are thinking of, and then proced with the purchase of sugested comopnents. the simulator comes along with visualization of raytracing simulatation.
